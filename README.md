A new way to play Fantasy Football


The goal with this project is to create a fanntasy football service that allows for more planning and control over your team and season. 

Features will (hopefully) include the following;
  1. Depth Charts
  2. Defensive players preventing your opponent from scoring points
  3. Coaching gameplans
  4. Salaries and salary caps (season long)
  
I am currently in the very early planning stages and would greatly appreciate some help with this if anyone is interested. 

If you are interested please send me an email at romeobravo92@gmail.com
