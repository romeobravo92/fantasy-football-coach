Other features that have not been fully fleshed out yet are as follows:

Consistency rating. 

This one is fairly simple overall, but instead of showing an average for points scored, I want to show a true reliability rating. 
  This can be done through shwoing the mean, median, mode and range. Then developing a rating based on how far apart each of these numbers are. 
  
  
Reliability rating.
  
 This is a bit more difficult. Here I want to show how likely or possible it is for a player to get injured, ejected, or benched in any given game. 
 Things to research:
        Injury breakdown by position
        Injury breakdown by gamenight situation (Monday Night Game, Thursday Night Game, Holiday Game, Game needed for playoff berth)
        Injury breakdown by location (Home, Away, International)
        Injury breakdown by mathcup (Does opposing team tend to injure players more commonly?)
        Injury breakdown by scenario (garbage time, chew clock)
        Injury breakdown by playtype (scramble, route styles etc)
