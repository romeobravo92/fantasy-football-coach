Depth Chart Details

The goal of adding a depth chart is to try and add some realism and options to guard against things like injuries, ejections, and poor performance. 
  In a real NFL game, you would have multiple players at each position and be able to swap them in or out accordingly. 
  
  Currently there are two ideas for this. One is the percentage model, and the other is the quarterly model. 
  
    Percentage model;
      With the percentage model, you would set your depth chart and order your players. If you had five running backs on your team then the percentage breakdown would be;
        RB1 = 100% of points scored gets added to total team score. 
        RB2 = 100% of points scored gets added to total team score. 
        RB3 = 50% of points scored gets added to total team score. 
        RB4 = 0% of points scored gets added to total team score. 
        RB5 = 0% of points scored gets added to total team score. 
              **Percentages are approximate and not final. 
    
      For example:
        RB1 scores 25 points
        RB2 scores 15 points
        RB3 scores 10 points
        RB4 scores 4 points
        RB5 scores 4 points
        
        Team RB score would be 45 points. 
        
    
    Quarterly Model;
      The quarterly model is aimed at setting up a pre-planned gameplan and exectuing it before final scores are posted. Based on each player's quarterly scoring.
      
      For example; 
          IF Player Quarterly Score is = 0 THEN Moved to next player. 
          
                                |Q1| |Q2| |Q3| |Q4|   |Total|
        RB1 : Ezekiel Elliott   |05| |07| |06| |00|   | 18  |
        RB2 : Carlos Hyde       |06| |02| |03| |04|   | 15  |
        Team RB Score:          |05| |07| |06| |04|   | 22  |
              **This would not allow backtracking if a player enters back into the game.
